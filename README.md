## User Story Cards
User Story Cards are available via this link in GitHub issues: [User Stories](https://github.com/orgs/uvic-seng321/projects/9/views/3)

User stories are sorted into "Must Have", "Should Have", and "Could Have" categories. The most important stories have checklists in their descriptions to detail how we will determine they are complete. Priority is given based on how essential the user story is to the final product. Another rating is given in the form of "Difficulty Estimate", with 13 being the highest priority and 1 being the lowest. The scale for the difficulty estimate is roughly the number of hours it will take to implement. We felt this was an appropriate scale since it's a relatively small project, so measuring in hours still allows for meaningful differences between story's ratings. We will focus the entire "Must Have" category before we begin with the highest "Should Have" story.

Data was collected via scraping with [APIFY](https://apify.com/), raw data is available in .csv format in [issue 2](https://github.com/uvic-seng321/project-decimal-dogs-5/issues/2). Additionally, we referenced existing tutor sites such as [SuperProf](https://www.superprof.ca/lessons/all-tutors/victoria/), [Varsity Tutors](https://www.varsitytutors.com/ca/tutoring-victoria), and [Tutoring with a Twist](https://tutoringwithatwist.ca/victoria-tutoring/) to get requirements related to more detailed website features such as tutor filters.
