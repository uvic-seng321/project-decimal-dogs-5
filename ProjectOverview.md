# Project Overview

## Project Vision
TutorUp strives to help university students connect with tutors to give them the skills they need to succeed in their classes. We wish to improve student grades and make the process of finding a tutor and finding people to tutor a simpler one.

## TutorUp Project Goals
The minimum viable product for TutorUp will allow users to register. They will by default be a “student” type, and will have the option both at registration and later on to add the “tutor” user type to their account. As students, users will be able to view tutors, rate tutors, and message tutors to arrange a tutoring session. Student users will be able to sort tutors by availability, classes they are offering to tutor for, rating, and in-person versus online tutoring sessions. As tutors, users will still be able to view and use all student functions. They will additionally be required to provide proof of passing this class previously. Tutors will also be able to submit a similar or equivalent class if they took that class at a different institution, or if there are similar classes offered at one university. Tutor users will be able to upload availability calendars, select which classes they wish to tutor for, and view their own rating and reviews. Tutors will be able to advertise if they offer online, in-person or hybrid tutoring. Tutors and students will be able to message each other in order to arrange meeting times, locations, and payment information.

### TutorUp Secondary Project Goals
Additional features we wish to implement include the ability for tutors to challenge poor ratings they think are undeserved. This will lead to a review period where both the student and tutor are able to give justification on why this rating is either deserved or undeserved. This will help minimize trolling on TutorUp.

## Need for TutorUp
TutorUp is needed as it is currently very difficult to find tutors, especially remote tutor offerings. People are searching for tutors in all different ways. Online, in person, and via university academic help centers.
